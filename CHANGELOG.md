## 0.7.3 - 2016-02-22

    down response levels and instead simply return the response

-   Added `ContactsAPI` for simple usage
-   Added examples for the ContactsAPI
-   Added `API::getChildrenFolders($parentFolderId, $options)`
-   Made `FindFolderParentType` and `ArrayOfFoldersType` iterable like the previous updates
-   Added a `CalendarAPI::setFolderId($folderId)` method

## 0.7.1 - 2015-12-07

-   `MailAPI::getMailItems()` now returns the `FindItemParentType`, which as of `0.7.0` is iterable.

## 0.7.0 - 2015-12-04

-   Implemented `ArrayAccess`, `AggregateIterator` and `Countable` on `ArrayOfRealItemsType`, `FindItemParentType` and
    `GroupedItemsType` to let you iterate over them directly. This should allow you to use responses more effectively and
    access other data that was previous lost (such as whether or not the responses returned were paginated). This is a breaking
    change because `getCalendarItems()` now returned a `FindItemParentType` object which, while you can use as an array,
    will return false on is_array()

## 0.6.7 - 2015-12-04

-   Adding an option to get the raw responses from requests instead of having them drilled down automatically

## 0.6.6 - 2015-12-04

-   getAttachment not returns the mimeContent of the attachment, which will allow for saving the file
-   Added `ItemAttachmentType::getItemAttachment()` which will return whichever item is not null
-   Field URI's for updating items are now case insensitive and will either return preference:name or item:name or throw
    and exception

## 0.6.5 - 2015-11-25

-   Fixed a bug in `CalendarAPI::createCalendarItems()` that caused options not to be overridden

## 0.6.4 - 2015-11-24

-   Added an `$options` parameter in `CalendarAPI::createCalendarItems($items, $options)` to allow you to override the
    default options
-   Allow you to create `ItemIdType` with only an `$itemId` and not a `$changeKey`

## 0.6.3 - 2015-11-20

-   Extracted the authentication part of the call in to a configuration option for future authentication
-   Added an `ExchangeWebServicesAuth` class for generating these options
-   Moved API and ExchangeWebServices constructors to static functions. `$api->buildClient()` will now be deprecated and
    removed in 0.7.0. Please use `$api = API::withUsernameAndPassword($server, $username, $password)` instead
-   Added support for Office 365 with tokens instead of usernames and passwords. This is an experimental feature

## 0.6.2 - 2015-11-19

-   Fixed a bug where Guzzle wasn't actually attempting NTLM Authentication. It does now

## 0.6.1 - 2015-11-18

-   Fixed file names for the recordings for the test. This should allow installation on windows machines again

## 0.6.0 - 2015-11-16

-   Added a `FolderIdType $folderId` option to `MailAPI::getMailItems()` and `MailAPI::getUnreadMailItems()`. Because this
    is a minor BC breaking change, it gets a new new minor version, since this is a pre-1.0 release.

## 0.5.11 - 2015-11-16

-   Added an `API::getMailbox(string $folderName = null)` function
-   Added a `MailAPI::setFolderId(FolderIdType $folderId)` function

## 0.5.10 - 2015-11-09

-   Fixing but in `MailAPI::markEmailAsRead()` and allowing you to set it as unread through the same function

## 0.5.9 - 2015-11-05

-   Adding ability to get the attachments of an eamil

## 0.5.8 - 2015-09-30

-   Fixed a test for Travis to pass

## 0.5.7 - 2015-09-28
